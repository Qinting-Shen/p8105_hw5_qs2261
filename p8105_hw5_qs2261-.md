### Peoblem 2

#### Import Data

``` r
filename = list.files("data", full.names = TRUE) # create a df containing all file names

importdata = function(path) {
  
  df = read_csv(path) |> 
    janitor::clean_names() |> 
    mutate(file = path)
}

longi_df = map(filename, importdata) |> 
  bind_rows()
```

#### Data Wrangling and Plotting

``` r
tidy_plot =
  longi_df |> 
  separate(file, into = c("folder","arm","underscore","subject_id","csv"), sep = c(5,8,9,11)) |> 
  select(-folder, -underscore, - csv) |> 
  select(arm, subject_id, everything()) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "observation" )|> 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = subject_id, color = subject_id))+
    facet_grid(~arm)+
    geom_line()

tidy_plot
```

The spaghetti plot shows that the observations on each subject in
control group fluctuates but remain stable, while those in experimental
group are increasing over time. And compared to control group, the mean
values of observations of each subject are higher in experimental group.

### Peoblem 3

#### Create a function

``` r
set.seed(1)
one_samp = function(n= 30, mu, sigma = 5){
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = n, mean = mu, sd = sigma),
  )
  
  broom::tidy(t.test(sim_data, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided"))
}
```

#### mu = 0, repeat 5000 times

``` r
ttest_results_df =
  rerun(5000, one_samp(mu = 0)) |> 
  bind_rows() |> 
  select(estimate, p.value)
```

#### Repeat for mu = 1,2,3,4,5,6

``` r
mu_list =

    "mu = 3" = 3,
    "mu = 4" = 4,
    "mu = 5" = 5,
    "mu = 6" = 6
  )

output = vector("list", length = 6)

for (i in 1:6) {
  output[[i]] = rerun(5000, one_samp(mu = mu_list[[i]])) |> 
    bind_rows() |> 
    select(estimate, p.value)
  
}
